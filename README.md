# crosslayer-features
Development repo for cross-layer feature research. I'll probably put out more comprehensive code for both the
crosscoder/SAE testing suite + the crosscoder visualizations. Hopefully.

A lot of the underlying crosscoder structure is from this [repo](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Crosscoders/tree/main) from Neel Nanda!
(It's been adapted to use the NNSight library and more tailored to the research use here).

The architecture here still needs tuning. I'm working on this! We get really wonky results and crosscoders tend to be very sensitive to a lot of hyperparameters.

I create a cool visualization dashboard (inspired by a Goodfire tweet I saw a while ago).
