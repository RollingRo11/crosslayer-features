## Key Architecture Components

1. **Multi-Layer Encoder**: Instead of a single encoder per layer, the crosscoder has an encoder that takes activations from multiple layers as input with shape `[n_layers, d_model, d_sae]`

2. **Multi-Layer Decoder**: A decoder that can reconstruct activations for multiple layers with shape `[d_sae, n_layers, d_model]`

3. **Loss Function**: The crosscoder uses a modified loss that balances reconstruction across layers:
   - L1-of-norms version: Loss is comparable to sum of individual SAE losses
   - L2-of-norms version: Encourages features to spread across layers

### Implementation Steps with NNsight

1. **Model Setup**:
   - Load GPT2 using NNsight's LanguageModel wrapper
   - Access residual stream activations across all layers using NNsight's tracing capabilities

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Use NNsight's `.trace()` context to collect activations from multiple layers simultaneously
   - Access each layer's residual stream: `model.transformer.h[i].output[0]`
   - Save activations across layers for training data

3. **Crosscoder Training Architecture**:
   - Implement encoder that processes concatenated multi-layer activations
   - Design decoder that outputs reconstructions for each layer
   - Use layer-wise normalization to ensure each layer contributes equally

4. **NNsight-Specific Features**:
   - Leverage intervention graphs to efficiently collect cross-layer activations
   - Use `.save()` to store activations from multiple layers in a single forward pass
   - Apply `.all()` on modules to streamline multi-token generation if needed

### Project Organization

1. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Script to harvest activations using NNsight's tracing
   - Buffer system for efficient training data management
   - Normalization factors computation for each layer

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Crosscoder class inheriting from nn.Module
   - Configurable number of features (e.g., 25k-50k)
   - Support for different activation functions (ReLU, TopK, JumpReLU)

3. **Training Loop**:
   - Multi-GPU support for large-scale training
   - Dead feature resampling strategies
   - Learning rate scheduling and warmup

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Cross-layer feature analysis
   - Comparison with baseline per-layer SAEs
   - Feature persistence tracking across layers

### Key Considerations

1. **Computational Efficiency**: Crosscoders are more parameter-efficient than training separate SAEs per layer, but require careful optimization

2. **Feature Interpretability**: Use NNsight's ability to apply modules out-of-order to decode features back to vocabulary space for interpretation

3. **Layer Selection**: Consider training on subsets of layers (e.g., early, middle, late) or all residual stream layers

4. **Remote Execution**: For large models, use NNsight's `remote=True` flag to leverage NDIF infrastructure

The NNsight library's intervention graph architecture makes it particularly well-suited for crosscoder implementation as it naturally handles the complex cross-layer dependencies and allows for efficient batched computation across multiple model layers.
