# crosslayer-features
Development repo for crosslayer feature research

A lot of the underlying crosscoder code/structure is from this [repo](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Crosscoders/tree/main) from Neel Nanda!
(It's been adapted to use the NNSight library)

## WIP:
- Crosscoder
- Web interface/visualizations
