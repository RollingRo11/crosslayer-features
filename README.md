# crosslayer-features
Development repo for cross-layer feature research. I'll probably put out more comprehensive code for both the
crosscoder/SAE testing suite + the crosscoder visualizations. Hopefully.

(Fair warning, literally all of the visualization code is vibe-coded)

A lot of the underlying crosscoder code/structure is from this [repo](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Crosscoders/tree/main) from Neel Nanda!
(It's been adapted to use the NNSight library because I wanted to learn
how to use NNSight)
