# crosslayer-features
Development repo for cross-layer feature research. I'll probably put out more comprehensive code for both the
crosscoder/SAE testing suite + the crosscoder visualizations. Hopefully.

A lot of the underlying crosscoder structure is from this [repo](https://github.com/neelnanda-io/Crosscoders/tree/main) from Neel Nanda!
(It's been adapted to use the NNSight library and more tailored to the research use here).
